# Minimati 

Minimati is a simple, lightweight and open-source CMS for managing blog posts in your website. It's written in 
PHP and uses MySQL for its database, so your site must have the ability to utilize these two. Minimati is best
for static websites that want to add simple blogging functionality without the need to write a custom
CMS or use third party software.

# FAQ

*Is there any way to measure user metrics?* <br>
Use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com). It's a cumbersome task to implement detailed user analytics,
especially when perfect solutions like Google Analytics exist.

*How do I add comments and replies to my blog?* <br>
I haven't come around to implementing that yet, as it would over-complicate things. For now, check out the easy-to-use service [Disqus](https://disqus.com).

*Happy blogging!*
