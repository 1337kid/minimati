# Minimati

Minimati is a simple, lightweight CMS for managing blog posts in your website. It's written in 
PHP and uses a MySQL backend, so your site must use these two for the backend. Minimati is best
for static websites that want to add simple blogging functionality without the need to write a custom
CMS or use something like WordPress and decrease performance.
