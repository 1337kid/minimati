# Minimati 

Minimati is a simple, lightweight and open-source headless CMS for managing blog posts in your website. It's written in PHP and uses MySQL for its database, so your site must have the ability to utilize these two. Minimati is best for static websites that want to add simple blogging functionality without the need to write a custom
CMS or use third party software. 

<b>If you're a web developer working on simple & static websites for your clients,
this CMS is great for you.</b>

# Setup Guide

Simply clone this repo in the directory you want your CMS to be stored in inside your server. For example:

<code>'[your-website]/cms'</code>

Afterwards, simply navigate to that directory in your browser to start the installation process. The default
image upload folder is <code>../assets/images/blog</code>. You can change this in the settings menu after you
finish installing Minimati.

# FAQ

*Is there any way to measure user metrics?* <br>
Use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com). It's a cumbersome task to implement detailed user analytics,
especially when perfect solutions like Google Analytics exist.

*How do I add comments and replies to my blog?* <br>
I haven't come around to implementing that yet, as it would over-complicate things. For now, check out the easy-to-use service [Disqus](https://disqus.com).

*Happy blogging!*
